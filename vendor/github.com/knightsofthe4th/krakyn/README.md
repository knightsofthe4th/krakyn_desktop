## What am I?
Decentralised, encrpyted, and secure chat and multimedia protocol. Designed as a replacement for centralised, big-tech platforms. With krakyn, anyone can setup their own server with minimal effort on nearly any hardware, and have control over their own hosted chat content. Unlike applications such as Discord, krakyn is simply a protocol. There is no central authority. This means that while server owners can mediate their own userbase, it is impossible to de-platform someone or to prevent them from using the protocol entirely.

### What's to come?
- [ ] Completed krakyn 1.0 Specification
- [ ] krakyn Library Implementation
- [ ] Basic Working Server

## How does it work?
Being decentralised, anyone can set up a self-hosted krakyn server. Clients then exchange security details with the server and connect. Servers can be for a small group of users, or they can be used for large swaths of connections. Provided the hardware is up to the task, any configuration can be met.

 <b>‚ùóThe specification/implementation are both work in progress and in [VERY] early stages. Everything is subject for breaking changes without notice.</b>
